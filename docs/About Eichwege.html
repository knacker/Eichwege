    <p>
        Eichwege exists since 1818 and used to be an independent village. Its population grew significantly due to the industrial revolution happening in Prussia where it was part of. However, the name Eichwege was not being enforced at this time. Instead, the village was called 'Dubraucke' and most of the people were speaking Wendish, a Sorbian language. This changed in the 20th century. In 1937 the name was changed to what it is now and in 1974 it became part of Döbern.
