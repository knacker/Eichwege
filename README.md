The some information and history about Eichwege. NOTE: Please create a hyperlink and don't just show the URL. 

### 3.2.2 Content
Eichwege exists since 1818 and used to be an independent village. Its population grew significantly due to the industrial revolution happening in Prussia where it was part of. However, the name Eichwege was not being enforced at this time. Instead, the village was called 'Dubraucke' and most of the people were speaking Wendish, a Sorbian language. This changed in the 20th century. In 1937 the name was changed to what it is now and in 1974 it became part of Döbern.

Eichwege is located in the southeast of Brandenburg, Germany. The landscape is shaped by the so called 'Muskauer Faltenbogen'. It is heavily forested and has many lakes. Espacially the 'Eichweger Badesee' is a lake that attracts many tourists every year. The following link is a representation of some special places at Döbern, it would be great when you embed this video on the website:

## 4. Layout and design

### 4.1 General Layout
The menu (fixed) should be on the left side of the screen. You should be able to collapse/expand the menu as well. This process should be shown using animations. Please take the menu of the BTU's Moodle website as a reference. 
A header is not needed. Instead, some of the pages have a header image on top of the page (not fixed). The image should change depending on the web page. On the left side of each image the logo with the name of the club should be displayed. Please use the images we have provided in the folder header_image. The images for each gender are the same. Their names tell you which image belongs to which page. If one page does not have a header image put the logo on the said position anyway. 
The footer (not fixed) should contain the logo and the name as well as a link to Contact. 

The following diagram is supposed to help you to understand what we mean:
